PROPOSAL 
Voting has always been an important part of our nationâ€™s democracy, and yet our voter turnout is extremely low when compared to other countries. Even our presidential elections rarely see more than two-thirds of eligible voters showing up to the polls, or even registering to vote. In recent years, there has been a push to increase voter registration and voter turnout through any means possible and we would like to create a mobile web-app that helps in the process. Our app would have a calendar that keeps track of important dates such as registration deadlines, absentee ballot deadlines, and election days. The app would also keep track of important measures on the ballot, candidates for office and other election information. As elections are constantly changing, we would like to keep the app updated with the latest information on elections in order to continue increasing voter turnout.

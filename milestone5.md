We updated the home page to better reflect some of our end functions. 

All screens also now include a navigation bar at the bottom.

# Non-trivial Actions

Our core functionality is comprised of a few parts. Users will be able to look up their friends on Last.fm from our app, and then by selecting one of those friends, they will be able to see a list of that person's top tracks in additiona to a image patchwork representation of those top tracks. The image patchwork will consist of the album artwork of each track and will be implemented later.

# Get Friends
This action will return a list of the users friends on Last.fm. This will eventually allow users to compare each other's top tracks and we will be visualizing this comparison through a patchwork of the top track's album art. This is to be implemented by the next milestone.

# Get Top Tracks
This action will return a list of the users top tracks over the span of a month. Users will be able to see their top tracks, the play count, and other relevant information pertaining to their top tracks list.

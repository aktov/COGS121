List of all the tracks that we receive from the lastfm api

As of milestone 4 we have connected our app to firebase and users can now request data from the last fm api.Newly created
accounts are also stored on firebase and used as references to user profiles. Their top songs are stored under the user. 

In terms of user privacy, as of right now, only users can see their own data. We will be implementing privacy controls once we connect 
all the APIs we need. There will be no use of anyone's location data, age, gender, or any other identifying imformation. Additionally 
once we connect everything, users will be able to control whether or not they want to share parts of their data.

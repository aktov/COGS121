The user can choose what he wants the visualizer to focus on; for instance
he can put in 'Basketball' or 'Brunch' and the visualizer will pull up friends
that has those in their profile.

This will hopefully be what our visualization will look like.

###### Differences from paper prototypes
# Differences
![Differences]
We sort of stuck to the social network visualization idea for the project as of right now. We kept part of the original app name, but made it shorter to be better branded in the end. We have not added all the functionality that was present in the paper prototypes as we are still learning the Facebook apis necessary to continue the project.
